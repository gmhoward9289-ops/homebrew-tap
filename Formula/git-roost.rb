# Homebrew formula for git-roost. The master copy lives in the git-roost repo at
# packaging/git-roost.rb and is copied here on release; edit it there, not here.
#
# homebrew-core is not an option yet -- it requires notability thresholds
# (stars/forks/watchers) that this project has not met.
#
# After tagging a release, refresh the checksum with:
#   curl -sL https://github.com/gmhoward9289-ops/git-roost/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.tar.gz | shasum -a 256
#
# Both the tag above and this checksum are verified by
# packaging/check-version-consistency.sh, which fetches the tarball and compares
# digests. That check exists because a stale formula cannot report itself:
# Homebrew derives `version` from this URL, so a formula left on an old tag
# checks the old version against the old tarball, agrees with itself, and passes
# -- while `brew install` quietly ships the previous release.

  # git is a runtime dependency in a way it is not for roost: with no git on
  # PATH every column is empty and the tool has nothing to say. Homebrew does
  # not install it (macOS ships one, and Linuxbrew users have their own), so
  # this is declared rather than depended on -- see the caveat below.

  def install
    # Installed as `git-roost`, without the .py suffix: the shebang and the
    # executable bit are what make it a command. This also makes git resolve
    # `git roost` to it, since git looks for a `git-<x>` on PATH.
    bin.install "git_roost.py" => "git-roost"
    # The shipped shebang is `/usr/bin/env python3`, which would resolve to
    # whatever python happens to be first on PATH -- including a virtualenv the
    # user activated for something else. Pin it to the formula's interpreter.

    <<~EOS
      git-roost reads local git state and needs `git` on PATH.

      It is read-only by construction: every git invocation is checked against an
      allowlist of plumbing that cannot mutate a tree, an index, or a ref.
