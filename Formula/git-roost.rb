# Homebrew formula for git-roost.
#
# This is the master copy; it is consumed by copying it to Formula/git-roost.rb
# in the tap repo (gmhoward9289-ops/homebrew-tap), which is what `brew install`
# reads. It lives here so the formula is versioned alongside the code it builds.
#
# homebrew-core is not an option yet -- it requires notability thresholds
# (stars/forks/watchers) that this project has not met.
#
# The url points at the sdist tarball uploaded to the GitHub Release, not
# GitHub's auto-generated archive/refs/tags/ URL. That URL isn't a release
# asset at all, so GitHub doesn't count `brew install` downloads in the repo's
# release download_count the way it does for the .deb/.whl assets -- roost's
# Homebrew traffic was invisible to any download tracking until this changed
# there (see roost's packaging/roost.rb), and leghorn followed. The secondary
# benefit is that the tarball Homebrew builds is byte-identical to the one PyPI
# serves, rather than a separately-generated archive of the same tag.
#
# The filename is git_roost-<version>.tar.gz, with an underscore, even though
# the distribution is named git-roost: PEP 625 makes hatchling normalise the
# name in the sdist filename. Do not "correct" it to a hyphen -- that URL 404s.
#
# The `x-release-please-version` marker on the `version` line is load-bearing:
# release-please's generic updater rewrites a version only inside such an
# annotation, so without it this file would be listed in the release config and
# silently left on the previous release. The homebrew-tap job in the release
# workflow then rewrites the `version` and `sha256` lines with computed
# literals, resolves the url's interpolation, and asserts the result matches the
# asset it just uploaded -- so both lines must keep their `  version "..."` /
# `  sha256 "..."` shape.
#
# The version appears in this file EXACTLY ONCE, on the `version` line below,
# and the url interpolates it for both the tag and the filename. roost learned
# this the hard way: with the version written twice on the url line, a bump
# rewrote only the first occurrence and shipped a url whose tag said the new
# release while its filename still said the old one. One occurrence means
# there is nothing to half-update -- and because the same rot can hide in a
# comment, check-version-consistency.sh rejects any version literal anywhere
# in this file other than the one on the `version` line. That is why the curl
# hint below is written versionless.
#
# After tagging a release, refresh the checksum with (versionless on purpose --
# fill in the tag you just cut):
#   curl -sL https://github.com/gmhoward9289-ops/git-roost/releases/download/v<version>/git_roost-<version>.tar.gz | shasum -a 256
#
# Both the version above and this checksum are verified by
# packaging/check-version-consistency.sh, which fetches the sdist and compares
# digests. That check exists because a stale formula cannot report itself:
# `version`, url and sha256 all move together, so a formula left on an old
# release checks the old version against the old tarball, agrees with itself,
# and passes -- while `brew install` quietly ships the previous release.

    <<~EOS
      git-roost reads local git state and needs `git` on PATH.

      After install, run `git-roost`. It opens the TUI and scans the current
      directory. Override with --root DIR or GIT_ROOST_ROOT. A missing root is
      an error. Use --once for a one-shot table.

      It is read-only by construction: every git invocation is checked against an
      allowlist of plumbing that cannot mutate a tree, an index, or a ref.
